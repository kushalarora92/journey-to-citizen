# Testing Fixes - October 6, 2024

## Summary
This document outlines all the fixes implemented based on user testing feedback.

---

## Profile Tab Changes

### 1. ✅ PR Date Label Updated
**Before:** "PR Landing Date"  
**After:** "PR Date"  
**Reason:** PR date may not always be the landing date

**Added:** Subtitle text - "Refer to the back of your PR Card or Confirmation of PR document"

### 2. ✅ Removed Administrative Fields
**Removed from UI:**
- Email Verified status (moved to warning banner only when not verified)
- Account Created date

**Reason:** These are administrative fields not relevant to user experience

### 3. ✅ Immigration Status Now Editable
**Implementation:**
- Added pencil icon next to Immigration Status
- Clicking opens a picker with all status options from shared types
- Uses `IMMIGRATION_STATUS_LABELS` constant from `@journey-to-citizen/types`
- When changing from PR to non-PR, automatically removes PR date and presence entries
- When changing to PR, shows PR date field

**Status Options:**
- Visitor
- Student (Study Permit)
- Worker (Work Permit)
- Permanent Resident

### 4. ✅ PR Date Now Editable
**Implementation:**
- Added pencil icon next to PR Date
- Clicking opens date picker with subtitle
- Only visible when immigration status is Permanent Resident
- If user changes status to non-PR, PR date is removed from system

## Time in Canada Before PR Modal

### 5. ✅ Purpose of Stay as Dropdown
**Before:** Text input field  
**After:** Dropdown/picker with predefined options

**Implementation:**
- Updated `DateRangeList` component to support `type: 'select'`
- Uses `PURPOSE_OF_STAY_LABELS` constant from shared types
- Options:
  - Visitor
  - Study Permit
  - Work Permit
  - Protected Person
  - Business
  - No Legal Status

---

## General Fixes

### 6. ✅ Modal Scrolling
**Issue:** Modals were not scrollable when content exceeded viewport  
**Fix:** Wrapped modal content in `ScrollView` component  
**Files affected:** `DateRangeList.tsx`

### 7. ✅ Documentation Organization
**Moved:**
- `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → `docs/3.implementation/`
- `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` → `docs/3.implementation/`

**Reason:** Better organization following documentation structure

### 8. ✅ Logout Button on All Pages
**Added logout button to:**
- Dashboard tab (already existed)
- Profile tab (NEW)
- Travel tab (NEW)

**Implementation:** Added `headerRight` to all tab screens in `_layout.tsx`

### 9. ✅ Date Picker Behavior Fixed
**Issue:** Date picker stayed open after selection on iPhone, blocking UI

**Fixes implemented:**
1. **Android:** Automatically closes after selection or dismissal
2. **iOS:** 
   - Added "Done" button to explicitly close picker
   - Picker closes on outside tap (event.type === 'dismissed')
   - Applied to all date pickers:
     - Profile Setup (PR Date)
     - Profile Tab (PR Date editing)
     - DateRangeList (From/To dates)

**Code pattern:**
```typescript
onChange={(event, date) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    setShowPicker(false);
  }
  if (date) setSelectedDate(date);
  if (event.type === 'dismissed') {
    setShowPicker(false);
  }
}}
```

## Shared Types Package Updates

### New Constants Added

```typescript
// Immigration Status
export const IMMIGRATION_STATUS = {
  VISITOR: 'visitor',
  STUDENT: 'student',
  WORKER: 'worker',
  PERMANENT_RESIDENT: 'permanent_resident',
} as const;

export const IMMIGRATION_STATUS_LABELS: Record<string, string> = {
  visitor: 'Visitor',
  student: 'Student (Study Permit)',
  worker: 'Worker (Work Permit)',
  permanent_resident: 'Permanent Resident',
};

// Purpose of Stay
export const PURPOSE_OF_STAY = {
  VISITOR: 'visitor',
  STUDY_PERMIT: 'study_permit',
  WORK_PERMIT: 'work_permit',
  PROTECTED_PERSON: 'protected_person',
  BUSINESS: 'business',
  NO_LEGAL_STATUS: 'no_legal_status',
} as const;

export const PURPOSE_OF_STAY_LABELS: Record<string, string> = {
  visitor: 'Visitor',
  study_permit: 'Study Permit',
  work_permit: 'Work Permit',
  protected_person: 'Protected Person',
  business: 'Business',
  no_legal_status: 'No Legal Status',
};
```

- Easy to maintain and extend

## Known Limitations

1. **Purpose of Stay Value Mismatch**
   - Display labels (e.g., "Study Permit") vs stored values (e.g., "study_permit")
   - Currently storing display labels - may need to map to underlying values
   - Consider adding reverse mapping if needed

2. **Status Change Confirmation**
   - Changing from PR to non-PR immediately removes PR date and presence entries
   - No confirmation dialog - might want to add one for safety

3. **Date Picker UI**
   - iOS spinner takes significant vertical space
   - Consider using modal picker for better UX on iOS

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**
   - Add confirmation when changing immigration status
   - Warn user about data loss (PR date, presence entries)

2. **Better Dropdown UI**
   - Consider using a proper dropdown library for iOS/Android
   - Add search functionality for longer lists

3. **Field Validation**
   - Add real-time validation for date ranges
   - Validate that PR date is before today
   - Validate presence entries are before PR date

4. **Undo Functionality**
   - Allow users to undo recent changes
   - Keep change history

5. **Data Export**
   - Allow users to export all their data
   - Include timestamps and change history

---

## Migration Notes

**No database migration required** - all changes are UI-only and use existing data structures.

**Existing users:**
- Immigration status field already exists
- PR date field already exists
- Presence entries already use purpose field
- No data conversion needed

**New constants:**
- Only used for display and validation
- Don't affect stored data structure
- Backward compatible
