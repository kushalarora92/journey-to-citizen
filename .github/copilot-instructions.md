- **Privacy / security measures**: Ensuring that user data is protected and secure, with clear privacy policies in place.


## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles
- Follow best practices for code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- This is a React Native application. It supports both iOS and Android platforms.
- In addition, it will also use React Native Web for web support.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- App is built using Expo with tabs navigation template.
- App supports both dark and light mode.
- Prioritize creating reusable components wherever possible (preferably themed components).
- Ensure the app is responsive and works well on various screen sizes and orientations.
- Write unit tests for critical components and functionalities.

### UI & Styling
- **!!IMPORTANT!!** ALWAYS use gluestack-ui components as the PRIMARY component library
  - Use `@gluestack-ui/themed` for all UI components (Box, VStack, HStack, Button, Input, etc.)
  - Use gluestack's theme tokens for colors: `$background`, `$textLight600`, `$primary500`, etc.
  - Leverage GluestackUIProvider for automatic dark/light mode support
- **IF** a component is not available in gluestack-ui, THEN use NativeWind and Tailwind CSS
- **AVOID** using React Native StyleSheet - unless component is very custom and cannot be achieved with gluestack or NativeWind
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain a consistent design language throughout the app using gluestack's design tokens

### Environment Variables
- **ALWAYS** use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side environment variables
- Access via `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` directly in code (works on iOS, Android, and Web)
- Store sensitive config in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Example: `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- **NO NEED** for `extra` object in `app.config.js` or `Constants.expoConfig.extra`

### Authentication Patterns (Firebase)
- Use React Context (`AuthContext`) for global auth state management
- Implement auth state persistence across app restarts
- Use `onAuthStateChanged` listener for real-time auth updates
- Route structure:
  - Unauthenticated users: `/auth/*` routes (sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password, verify-email)
  - Authenticated users: `/(tabs)/*` routes
  - Root layout handles auth state checking and routing
- Platform-specific considerations:
  - Use `Platform.OS === 'web'` checks for web-specific features
  - Use `Alert.alert()` for native, custom modals/toasts for web
- Firebase config in `/config/firebase.ts` using `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables

### Component Patterns
- Always export both named and default exports for consistency
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use gluestack's built-in variants and sizes for consistency
- Example structure:
  ```tsx
  import { Box, VStack, Button, Heading } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
  
  export default function MyComponent() {
    return (
      <Box flex={1} bg="$background">
        <VStack space="md">
          <Heading>Title</Heading>
          <Button action="primary">Action</Button>
        </VStack>
      </Box>
    );
  }
  ```

### File Organization
- Auth screens: `app/auth/*.tsx`
- Shared contexts: `context/*.tsx`
- Firebase config: `config/firebase.ts`
- Reusable components: `components/*.tsx`
- Environment variables: `.env` (with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix)
