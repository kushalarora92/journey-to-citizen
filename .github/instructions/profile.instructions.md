When creating user profiles, please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and clarity:

Profile creation is the first step for users to access the platform's features. 

As soon as user logs in for the first time, prompt them to create their profile.

Keep all other tabs disabled until the profile is created.

Ask user about their current status in Canada (e.g., visitor, student, worker, permanent resident).

Followed by PR Landing / entry date.

Based on the information, eligibility date is computed and displayed on dashboard.
