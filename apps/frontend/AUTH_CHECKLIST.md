## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run on web
pnpm web

# Run on iOS
pnpm ios

# Run on Android
pnpm android

# Clear cache if issues
pnpm start --clear
```

## Quick Firebase Setup

1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Create/select project
3. Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Email/Password ‚Üí Enable
4. Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your apps ‚Üí Config

   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="..."
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="..."
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="..."
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
   FIREBASE_APP_ID="..."
   ```

## Emergency Troubleshooting

If nothing works:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `.expo` folders
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm start --clear`
4. Check Firebase Console for errors
5. Verify `.env` file is correct
6. Check that `app.config.js` loads env vars
7. Restart VS Code/IDE
