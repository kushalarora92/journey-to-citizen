# Authentication Updates - Email Verification Flow

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Documentation Organization
All authentication documentation has been moved to `docs/1.auth/`:
- `AUTH_README.md` - Complete authentication overview
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions  
- `AUTH_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick API reference
- `AUTH_FLOW_DIAGRAMS.md` - Visual flow diagrams
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details

A master `docs/README.md` has been created to organize all documentation.

### 2. ✅ Email Verification Required
Users now **must verify their email** before accessing the app:

#### New Flow:
```
Sign Up → Email Verification Screen → Sign In → Verify Email → Dashboard
```

#### What Changed:
- **New Screen**: `app/auth/verify-email.tsx` shows verification instructions
- **Updated Navigation**: Root layout checks email verification status
- **Blocked Access**: Unverified users cannot access protected routes
- **Clear Instructions**: Users see step-by-step verification guide

#### User Experience:
1. User signs up with email/password
2. Account is created and verification email is sent
3. User is shown "Verify Your Email" screen with:
   - Email address they signed up with
   - Clear instructions (Check inbox → Click link → Return to app)
   - Option to resend verification email
   - "Back to Sign In" button
4. User must verify email before accessing the app
5. After verification, user can sign in and access dashboard

### 3. ✅ Better Error Messages on Web
Fixed error handling to work properly on both web and mobile:

#### Sign In Errors:
- ❌ `Invalid email or password` - Wrong credentials
- ❌ `No account found with this email` - Email not registered
- ❌ `Too many failed attempts. Please try again later` - Rate limited
- ❌ `Invalid email address` - Bad email format

#### Sign Up Errors:
- ❌ `An account with this email already exists` - Duplicate email
- ❌ `Invalid email address` - Bad email format
- ❌ `Password is too weak` - Weak password
- ❌ `Password must be at least 6 characters` - Too short

All errors now display properly on web using `Alert.alert()` which falls back to browser alerts on web.

### 4. ✅ Logout Confirmation on Web
Fixed logout button to work on web:

**Before**: Alert.alert didn't show on web
**After**: 
- Mobile: Uses native Alert.alert with modal
- Web: Uses `window.confirm()` browser dialog

Both show confirmation before logging out.

## Testing the Changes

### Test Email Verification Flow
1. Sign up with a new email
2. You should see "Verify Your Email" screen
3. Check your email for verification link
4. Click the verification link
5. Return to app and sign in
6. Now you can access the dashboard

### Test Unverified User Block
1. Sign up with a new email (don't verify)
2. Try to navigate to any tab
3. You should be redirected to verify-email screen
4. Cannot access dashboard until verified

### Test Error Messages
1. **Wrong Password**: Try signing in with wrong password → See "Invalid email or password"
2. **Duplicate Email**: Try signing up with existing email → See "Account already exists"
3. **Invalid Email**: Try "test@test" → See "Invalid email address"
4. **Weak Password**: Try "123" → See "Password must be at least 6 characters"

### Test Web Logout
1. Open app in web browser
2. Sign in
3. Click logout button
4. Should see browser confirm dialog
5. Confirm to logout

## Security Improvements

1. ✅ **Email Verification Required** - Users cannot access app without verifying
2. ✅ **Clear Error Messages** - No generic errors that might confuse users
3. ✅ **Logout Confirmation** - Prevents accidental logouts on both platforms
4. ✅ **Proper Navigation Guards** - Email verification checked before allowing access

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Warnings
There are some TypeScript warnings about route types. These are expected with Expo Router's typed routes and don't affect functionality. The routes work correctly at runtime.

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
1. ~~Email verification required~~ ✅ **DONE**
2. Social authentication (Google, Apple)
3. Phone number verification
4. Two-factor authentication
5. Biometric authentication
6. Password strength meter
7. Remember me functionality

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the verification email in spam folder
2. Use "Resend Verification Email" button
3. Check Firebase Console for authentication logs
4. Review browser console for any errors
5. Ensure Firebase is properly configured in `.env`
